<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Each week you may&nbsp;be assigned questions and topics to discuss in the&nbsp;Discussions&nbsp;forum. An online "forum" is a place where you post your written responses to the week's topics, and then read and reply to your classmates' thoughts. This is like hanging out in the coffee shop and chatting (except it's about schoolwork, and you don't have to sit at the table together)!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You will earn points in the discussion Your contributions should reflect having read (and watched) the material and always show respect for others and their opinions.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Read the directions for the discussion. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Take your time writing the assignment. I grade it like any written assignment (see below). I suggest you save your work on your computer or memory device, to protect you in case of a computer error while you are posting.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Initial postings should be at least 200 words</strong>. Edit carefully--make every word count. In general, I will not take points off for going over this word count unless the post is excessively long, but I do take off points for posts that are too short or that contain a lot of grammatical errors.&nbsp;<em>Note: you may copy my questions into your answer, but my words do not count toward your required words. :-)</em></span></li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note: do not simply cut and paste material from a website or the textbook!&nbsp;I am looking for your own thoughts and ideas backed up by these sources. When you do use short quotes or summarize material from websites or the textbook, be sure to correctly cite your sources to avoid any type of plagiarism. (When using the textbook, page number is sufficient.)</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If required, you respond to at least 2 other students by the due date.These responses are worth up to 5 points total.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Go back to the&nbsp;Discussion and read other students’ answers to the topic.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When you see an answer that interests you, click “reply" then type your response.&nbsp;<strong>Responses should be at least 100 words.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Replies can include contrasting their answer to your own, adding more material, or bringing up questions related to their post.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Do not expect credit for brief responses, such as “good post!”</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You may respond to more than 2 classmates if you wish, but you will not receive additional points for doing so.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;I grade assignments as I would grade an essay test—just posting something won’t get you the points! In order to get full points, you must demonstrate the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That you have followed directions for length of posting.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That your posting has depth and clarity (write carefully so you’re really getting your point across), originality (post early!), and timeliness.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That you have read and understood the material.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That you can use your own ideas to apply those concepts to new situations.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That you have followed the class ground rules for discussion, and have shown respect for diverse backgrounds and opinions.</span></li>
</ul>
