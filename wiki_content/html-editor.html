<h3>HTML Editor</h3>
<p>There are many freeware HTML editors available for use during your studies within this program.&nbsp; I am a big proponent of freeware.&nbsp; I've been a starving student, I know what it means to find it difficult to pay bills.&nbsp; So when every possible, I find the freeware options for students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="border: thin black solid; padding: 25px 25px 25px 25px;"><em>Lesson Objective:&nbsp; install and work with the essential tools / software used by web developers / designers: html editors, css editor, simple graphics editor or creators, and ftp software<br></em></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many students entering this program have experience writing HTML and using an HTML editor.&nbsp; I encourage you to use the HTML editor that you are accustom to using as long as it has a code-based screen.&nbsp; During these next modules, 18 through 26, you will be required to do most of your work from the code side, not the WYSIWYG side or design screen side.&nbsp; When choosing an editor, I have some suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the editor has a strong community, including a forum where you can post questions about the use of the editor</li>
<li>Make sure the editor has good tutorials about how to get started and how to accomplish specific tasks</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Suggested editors include:</li>
<ul>
<li>
<a class="external" href="http://kompozer.net/" target="_blank"><span><span>Kompozer</span></span></a> for Windows, Mac, and Linux OS.</li>
<li>Dreamweaver. By far the most commonly used editor in Web development.&nbsp; However, it is expensive. Available for both Mac and Windows.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE</a> - Quickly and easily develop desktop, mobile and web applications with Java, HTML5, PHP, C/C++ and more.</li>
<li>
<a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36179" target="_blank"><span><span>Microsoft Expression Web 4</span></span></a>. Free download works with Windows systems.</li>
<li>
<a class="external" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank"><span><span>Notepad++</span></span></a> for Windows</li>
<ul>
<li>A good video about downloading and installing a Notepad++ editor by Bucky Roberts of thenewboston.org (you will see a lot of Bucky in the next few months)<a class="external youtubed" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqszz_OfAFQ" target="_blank"><span><span><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title long-title yt-uix-expander-head">XHTML and CSS Tutorial - 1 - Downloading a Text Editor</span></span></span></a>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
If none of these editors are to your liking, don't be afraid to do some more searching there are new editors put out there every day.&nbsp; I would be sure that you do a virus scan on the downloaded software before you install these on to your computer.</div>
<div style="background-color: #bbd6ef; padding: 0px 25px 25px 25px;">By the way, my own personal choice for an editor, isn't available anymore. It's an oldie but a goodie, called Homesite.&nbsp; Today, I'm working a bit more with Netbeans, another freebee.</div>
