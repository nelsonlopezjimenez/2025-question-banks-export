<em>Lesson Objective:&nbsp; At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:<br></em><br><ul>
<li>Compare popular client-side and server-side programming languages, including JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, .Net, C, C++, Visual Basic, C#.</li>
<li>Define Common Gateway Interface (CGI) methods, including .Net, Django, Python, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Server-Side JavaScript (SSJS), Active Server Pages (ASP), PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), Ajax.</li>
<li>Identify ways to use additional technologies to provide custom features to an end user (e.g., using JavaScript to detect Web browser type, using cookies).</li>
</ul>

<p><br>In your last lesson, you saw how adding video, audio, and extending images can enhance Web pages.&nbsp; In this lesson you are at the beginnings of dissecting Web pages in order to extend what you can do on the Web.</p>
<p>Please read <a href="http://www.codeconquest.com/website/client-side-vs-server-side/">Client Side vs. Server Side</a> at codequest.com for another look at the differences between these two scripting possibilities.</p>
<p>As defined at Wikipedia, client-side scripting</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Client-side scripting generally refers to the class of computer programs on the web that are executed client-side, by the user's web browser, instead of server-side (on the web server).[1] This type of computer programming is an important part of the Dynamic HTML (DHTML) concept, enabling web pages to be scripted; that is, to have different and changing content depending on user input, environmental conditions (such as the time of day), or other variables."</p>
<p>And the definition of server-side scripting</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Server-side scripting is a technique used in website design which involves embedding scripts in an HTML source code which results in a user's (client's) request to the server website being handled by a script running server-side before the server responds to the client's request. The scripts can be written in any of a number of server-side scripting languages available (see below). Server-side scripting differs from client-side scripting where embedded scripts, such as JavaScript, are run client-side in the web browser."</p>
