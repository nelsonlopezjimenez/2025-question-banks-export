<h2>2025 question_banks README</h2>
<h3>11.4.2024 mdy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Created quizzes for each cis241 chapter 1-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, as well as exercises from w3s HTML/CSS and React</li>
<li>Selected all the questions in the question bank from 2025question_bank (2544594) that was imported from 2021questions-banks - 2092510 originally from Ho but already modified, added, deleted, created new banks, etc</li>
<li>Exported all the quizzes with pre 2025</li>
<li>PLAN: import them in unit E canvas</li>
</ul>
<h3>11.3.2024 mdy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exporting from edmonds canvas to correctionsed canvas did not transfer the question_banks, even if the whole package was uploaded. By trying to select the items, the question_banks item was not present.</li>
<li>So I have to move into sbctc regular canvas and create a new shell for 2025questions_banks (this)</li>
<li>First try copy from edmonds 2021question_banks whole course.</li>
<li>if fails: try to select content, to see whether the items appear, including question_banks</li>
<li>Then export from sbctc and try to import to correctionsed</li>
<li>then create onemodule, or another course in sbctc to be able to export just one module&nbsp;</li>
<li>Then export onemodule to correctionsed to prepare the export to unit E canvas</li>
<li>It did not work. Correctionsed canvas is a moving target. Apparently I could import a quiz that automatically generated a bank few days ago. Today not anymore.</li>
</ul>
