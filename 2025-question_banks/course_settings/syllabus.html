<h1 id="h.8vyh5iexwde0" class="c16"><span class="c22 c21">Course Overview</span></h1>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">This class is an introduction to web application development. It is a hands-on, project-oriented class that introduces students to fundamentals of programming for the web, such as understanding the major components of websites, basics of programming languages for the web (like PHP, JavaScript), and hands-on training to build a database-driven web application. In addition, the class includes discussions and considerations of the ethics of web-application design and development and takes a critical look at contemporary web apps.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Though we are specifically focused on JavaScript web app frameworks, the concepts taught in this course have applications across many platforms. </span></p>

<h1 id="h.m1460jbpwe" class="c16"><span class="c22 c21">Class Format</span></h1>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Our classes are split between a weekly lecture, online/asynchronous resources that you are responsible for reading/viewing/completing, and homework assignments. I expect you to attend our classes (online during the COVID pandemic, of course) unless you give me prior notice. I expect you to complete the online portion of our lessons and your assignments in a timely fashion unless you make prior arrangements with me.</span></p>
<h1 id="h.u9z82989qmg4" class="c16"><span class="c22 c21">What I Expect of You</span></h1>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Homework and Readings</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">This course requires outside work. That will take two forms. &nbsp;</span></p>
<ul class="c20 lst-kix_7wtdzckmplen-0 start">
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Coding on a team project and some individual coding exercises.</span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Reading and watching resources that I provide.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">My expectation of you is that you will do this work to the best of your ability. This outside work is crucial to successfully completing this course</span></p>
<h2 id="h.tg97ykkrm2n0" class="c8"><span class="c4">Attendance</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">It is crucial that you attend each lecture period. We have a very limited amount of face-to-face time. Please make sure that you are on each of the class Zoom sessions and have your camera on when possible.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Attendance will be graded. If you are unable to attend class, please let me know at least 24 hours beforehand. </span></p>
<h2 id="h.86hxwlcw3oen" class="c8"><span class="c4">Grading Criteria</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">The AD degree program requires that you maintain at least 2.0 GPA in your classes. A B-grade represents more than adequate understanding and effort. An A-grade is an exceptional measure of success.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">To achieve more than basic success you will need to demonstrate individual expertise and quality. The grading rubrics will be clearly communicated and if you have any questions for me or need any clarification, I expect that you will ask for clarification within 24 hours of the assignment being posted.</span></p>
<h3 id="h.if4r23x7u5ps" class="c14"><span class="c23 c21">Code Quality</span></h3>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Writing code that works is only part of what makes a good software developer. If code can’t be read, debugged, or extended then it isn’t useful. I will be grading on code quality, but you don’t have to get it right the first time. After I give feedback, I will allow re-submission.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">The best way to ensure that your code meets these standards is to follow these guidelines.</span></p>
<ol class="c20 lst-kix_39efa19jgiuu-0 start" start="1">
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Format your code consistently. Indentation, line breaks and consistent spacing are all critical to readability.</span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Make sure that logic statements (e.g. if (a&lt;b)) are as simple as possible. </span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Use descriptive, self-explanatory, names for your variables, functions and classes. For instance, if you have a function that adds two variables, name it ‘addTwoNumbers’ instead of ‘a’. I WILL NOT ACCEPT ONE-LETTER NAMES!!!</span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0">
<span>Follow a style guide. I prefer either the </span><span>AirBnb <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript" target="_blank">style guide</a> or W3C <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp" target="_blank">style guide</a></span>
</li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0">
<span>Use a linter like </span><span>eslint</span><span class="c3">. There will be an extra credit assignment to implement linting to demonstrate this in week 3.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h.sgyjd9fpbivf" class="c14"><span class="c23 c21">Late Work</span></h3>
<p class="c6"><span class="c3">The total point value of an assignment submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10% every day it is late. Late work will not be accepted more than one week after the due date. If you believe that outside circumstances will impede your ability to submit an assignment on time, you must reach out at least 24 hours before the assignment is due.</span></p>
<h3 id="h.7drvrnrrfkb4" class="c24"><span class="c23 c21">Re-Submitting Work</span></h3>
<p class="c2"><span>I am happy to grade homework again after it has been submitted the first time. </span><span>You can earn credit back by putting in the work to address the feedback I give you for up to one week after the assignment is due</span><span class="c3">. You may or may not be able to earn full credit after the first submission based on the circumstances.</span></p>

<h2 id="h.js3dp0nqtrpr" class="c8"><span class="c4">Asking for Help</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">When you come to me for help with an assignment I will expect that you have first done your due diligence to research the issue. This includes:</span></p>
<ul class="c20 lst-kix_mehif7483wx1-0 start">
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Searching for an error message or output in google and stack overflow</span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">post your issue on the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> "Discussion Group"</strong></span> on Canvas.</span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Working with your teammates to discover an answer</span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Read or researched the general concept through a tutorial or one of the resources I've provided</span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Be sure that you can describe the behavior you've observed and the steps you've tried so far.</span></li>
<li class="c2 c9 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">If you want help with some portion of your app, make sure the code you wish me to review is available in GitHub.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Learning how to ask questions and search for answers is critical.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">At no point will I accept screenshots of code as a valid debugging tool. Any code submitted for review must be checked into Git.</span></p>
<h2 id="h.4tfrnyewmjxj" class="c8"><span class="c4">Collaboration</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I expect you to work with your peers respectfully and cooperatively. Soft skills are part of the selection process for any industry. A failure to work well with other students will have a negative impact on your grade.</span></p>
<h2 id="h.hflki17q4w56" class="c8"><span class="c4">Classroom Conduct</span></h2>
<p class="c6"><span class="c3">Regular class sessions will be conducted through Zoom from 6pm to 8:40pm every Wednesday. The goal of the lecture periods will be to augment your understanding and address topics as needed. The material we cover in class will be critical. Your attendance is requisite, and if you expect an absence or if you have to take time to care for yourself or others, give me as much notice as possible and we will make arrangements.</span></p>
<h2 id="h.7p78ogv9w3d8" class="c8"><span class="c4">Academic Honesty</span></h2>
<p class="c6"><span class="c3">Using code from other repositories and developers is common practice in professional software development, but there is a difference between using and adapting other’s code and copying code without understanding it. It is critical to your learning that you understand the code and frameworks you use. </span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c3">Reuse of code produced by other developers without attribution is plagiarism and, in some cases, a crime. Copying and pasting code from Stack Overflow or elsewhere without adaptation or comprehension is plagiarism. Any act of plagiarism will result in significant penalties to the student’s final grade.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="c6"><span class="c3">As long as you acknowledge the source and you are able to explain the source code in your own words and the modifications you made to be able to solve the task, you are OK.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 id="h.g7bb78ovonv3" class="c16"><span class="c21 c22">What You Should Expect of Me</span></h1>
<h2 id="h.bfqr6f48k85q" class="c8"><span class="c4">Clear Communication</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I will ensure that all assignments and classroom communications are clear and that information is available. I will happily respond to any clarifying questions you have. So long as your question of me is professional and reasonable, I will respond in kind.</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c13">I will not guarantee a response to slack or canvas email messages between the hours of 9pm and 8am.</span></p>
<h2 id="h.vxzjxfd8x2oh" class="c8"><span class="c4">Grading and Feedback</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I will grade assignments and provide feedback no more than 72 hours after an assignment is submitted. I will always make clear the reason for your grade and (as stated in the grading policy above) am happy to grade assignments again if you would like to address the feedback I give you.</span></p>
<h2 id="h.tceetut7g629" class="c8"><span class="c4">Reasonable response time for questions</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">I will answer any questions sent through the program Slack workspace or to canvas email within 24 hours. Please make sure that you include @nelson.lopez when messaging me in a class channel in slack.</span></p>
<h2 id="h.l3j4bu9v86yr" class="c8"><span class="c4">Help outside of normal classroom hours</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span>While I have limited time to hold one-on-one sessions, I am happy to help to the best of my ability. Please feel free to ask for individual or group time outside of class (i.e. office hours) and we’ll find a reasonable time to </span><span>meet</span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
<h2 id="h.m1iok434kfmi" class="c8"><span class="c4">Assistance, Accessibility and Reasonable Accommodations</span></h2>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">Above and beyond the policies and obligations of North Seattle College, I do everything in my power to be anti-racist and supportive of All my students. You may always reach out to me if you feel concerned about my, or other student’s, behavior. </span></p>
<p class="c2"><span>If you feel more comfortable speaking to someone else, I encourage you to reach out to Michelle Melero (</span><span class="c1"><a class="c5" href="mailto:michelle.melero@seattlecolleges.edu">michelle.melero@seattlecolleges.edu</a></span><span>) or William Brown, the Associate Dean of Workforce Education (</span><span class="c1"><a class="c5" href="mailto:William.Brown@seattlecolleges.edu">William.Brown@seattlecolleges.edu</a></span><span class="c3">).</span></p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c3">If you need or want any accommodations in class, please let me know. Accommodation includes, but is not limited to:</span></p>
