# 2025 Question Banks README

## 10.19.2025
1. Repository created from a imscc export from [https://canvas.corrections.sbctc.edu](https://canvas.corrections.sbctc.edu/courses/392419000000497)
1. It is a unreliable clone of same canvas shell on:
    1. [https://canvas.sbctc.correctionsed.com](https://canvas.sbctc.correctionsed.com/courses/392419000000529/question_banks) - Disabled
    1. https://canvas.ed at WSR/TRU/MSU - only local access
    1. [https://sbctc.instructure.com/2544595](https://sbctc.instructure.com/2544595) - publicly available
    1. [https://edmonds.instructure.com](https://edmonds.instructure.com) - online from Edmonds College
1. Test reliability 
1. Create a question bank editor

## 11.4.2024 mdy

1. Created quizzes for each cis241 chapter 1-2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, as well as exercises from w3s HTML/CSS and React
1. Selected all the questions in the question bank from 2025question_bank (2544594) that was imported from 2021questions-banks - 2092510 originally from Ho but already modified, added, deleted, created new banks, etc
1. Exported all the quizzes with pre 2025
1. PLAN: import them in unit E canvas

1. Exporting from edmonds canvas to correctionsed canvas did not transfer the question_banks, even if the whole package was uploaded. By trying to select the items, the question_banks item was not present.
1. So I have to move into sbctc regular canvas and create a new shell for 2025questions_banks (this)
1. First try copy from edmonds 2021question_banks whole course.
1. if fails: try to select content, to see whether the items appear, including question_banks
1. Then export from sbctc and try to import to correctionsed
1. then create onemodule, or another course in sbctc to be able to export just one module 
1. Then export onemodule to correctionsed to prepare the export to unit E canvas
1. It did not work. Correctionsed canvas is a moving target. Apparently I could import a quiz that automatically generated a bank few days ago. Today not anymore.
